# ✅ Report Date Auto-Fill - Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Field:** Report date (occurredAt)
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented

---

## Summary

The **"Report date"** field (internally called `occurredAt`) now automatically fills with **today's date** in both the API batch upload and the Chrome Extension form filler.

---

## How It Works

### 1. API Batch Upload (Automatic)

When uploading records via the API, the `occurredAt` field is automatically set to the current date:

**Files Updated:**
- `lib/field-mapper.js` (line 266)
- `dhims2-chrome-extension/src/utils/field-mapper.js` (line 169)
- `dhims2-chrome-extension/src/background/api-uploader.js` (line 391)

**Code:**
```javascript
const currentDate = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
const event = {
  occurredAt: currentDate,  // Automatically filled with current date
  // ... other fields
};
```

**Result:** Every API request includes `occurredAt` with today's date automatically.

---

### 2. Chrome Extension Form Filler (Automatic)

When using the Chrome Extension's auto-fill feature, the "Report date" field is filled using the special `__TODAY__` value.

**Template Configuration** (`dhims2-corrected-template.json`):
```json
{
  "formField": "Report date",
  "selector": "div[data-test='dataentry-field-occurredAt'] input",
  "type": "date",
  "excelColumn": "__TODAY__",
  "required": true,
  "fuzzyMatch": false,
  "autoFill": "today"
}
```

**Updated File:**
- `dhims2-chrome-extension/src/content/inject.js` (line 406-408)

**Code Added:**
```javascript
} else if (field.excelColumn === '__TODAY__' || field.autoFill === 'today') {
  // Automatically fill with current date
  value = '__TODAY__';
```

**Processing:**
```javascript
// Later in fillField function (line 316-318)
if (value === '__TODAY__' || value === 'today') {
  const today = new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0];
  value = today;
}
```

**Result:** The form filler detects `__TODAY__` and replaces it with the current date before filling the field.

## What This Means for Users

### ✅ No Excel Column Needed
Users **do NOT need** to add a "Report date" column in their Excel file. The system handles it automatically.

### ✅ Always Current
Every record uploaded will have the correct date of entry (today's date), regardless of when the patient was admitted.

### ✅ Works in Both Modes

| Mode | How It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Batch API Upload** | `occurredAt` field automatically set in API payload |
| **Form Auto-Fill** | Report date field automatically filled in DHIS2 form |

---

## Field Distinction

It's important to understand the difference between these fields:

| Field | Source | Purpose | Auto-Filled? |
|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Report date** (`occurredAt`) | Automatic | When data was entered into DHIS2 | ✅ Yes - always today |
| **Date of Admission** (`HsMaBh3wKed`) | Excel column | When patient was admitted to hospital | ❌ No - from Excel |
| **Date of Discharge** (`sIPe9r0NBbq`) | Excel column | When patient was discharged | ❌ No - from Excel |

---

## Example Scenario

**Today's Date:** October 31, 2025

**Excel Data:**
```
Patient No.      | Date of Admission | Date of Discharge
VR-A01-AAG3418   | 26-06-2025       | 27-06-2025
```

**What Gets Filled:**
```json
{
  "occurredAt": "2025-10-31",  // ← Automatically today (Oct 31)
  "dataValues": [
    {
      "dataElement": "HsMaBh3wKed",
      "value": "2025-06-26"  // ← From Excel (June 26)
    },
    {
      "dataElement": "sIPe9r0NBbq",
      "value": "2025-06-27"  // ← From Excel (June 27)
    }
  ]
}
```

**In the DHIS2 Form:**
- **Report date:** 31-10-2025 (automatically filled)
- **Date of admission:** 26-06-2025 (from Excel)
- **Date of discharge:** 27-06-2025 (from Excel)

---

## Technical Details

### Date Format
- **Internal (ISO):** `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-10-31`)
- **DHIS2 Display:** `DD-MM-YYYY` (e.g., `31-10-2025`)
- **Conversion:** Handled automatically by the system

### Timezone
- Uses local browser/system time
- Converted to UTC via `Date().toISOString()`
- Date portion only (time is stripped off)

### Special Values Supported
- `__TODAY__` - Replaced with current date
- `today` - Alternative format (case-insensitive)

---

## Testing

To verify this is working:

### Test 1: API Upload
1. Run the batch uploader with any Excel file
2. Check the API payload in the network tab
3. Verify `occurredAt` matches today's date

### Test 2: Form Auto-Fill
1. Open DHIS2 in Chrome
2. Load the extension template
3. Start auto-fill with any row
4. Check that "Report date" field shows today's date

## User Documentation

### For Excel Preparation
**No action needed!** Simply prepare your Excel file with the standard columns:
- Patient No.
- Locality/Address/Residence
- Age
- Gender
- ... (all other fields)

**DO NOT add a "Report date" column** - it's automatic!

### For Template Setup
The default template already includes the Report date auto-fill:
```json
{
  "formField": "Report date",
  "excelColumn": "__TODAY__",
  "autoFill": "today"
}
```

If creating a custom template, use either:
- `"excelColumn": "__TODAY__"`
- `"autoFill": "today"`
