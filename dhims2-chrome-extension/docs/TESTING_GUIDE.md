   - Patient number
   - Date range
   - Organization unit
4. Verify data accuracy:
   - Patient details correct
   - Diagnosis codes correct (especially auto-fixed ones)
   - All fields populated

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… All successful records appear in DHIS2
- âœ… Data is accurate
- âœ… Auto-fixed codes are correct

---

## Test 13: Error Handling

**Test with invalid data:**

1. Create Excel with intentionally bad data:
   - Invalid dates (e.g., "not-a-date")
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid diagnosis codes (no alternatives)
2. Upload and proceed to validation
3. Verify errors are caught
4. Try to upload anyway

**Expected Result:**
- âœ… Validation catches errors
- âœ… Cannot proceed with invalid records

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Upload button disabled
**Solution:** Verify all records are valid in preview step

### Issue: Progress not updating
**Solution:** Check service worker console for errors

### Issue: All records failing
**Solution:** Verify API config, check DHIS2 connectivity

### Issue: Auto-fix confidence too low
**Solution:** Codes may need manual correction in Excel

### Issue: Extension not loading
**Solution:** Rebuild with `deno task build`, reload extension
