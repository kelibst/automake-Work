# Upload Verification & Debugging Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Issue:** User reports uploads show "success" but data doesn't appear in DHIMS2
**Status:** ✅ Enhanced logging and verification added

---

## Summary

Added comprehensive logging and verification mechanisms to diagnose and confirm whether uploads are actually reaching DHIMS2. The extension **DOES perform real HTTP POST requests** to DHIMS2, but we've added tools to verify the data is actually saved.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Upload Logging ([api-uploader.js](../src/background/api-uploader.js))

#### Before Upload (buildPayload logging)
```javascript
console.log('🔨 Building payload for record:', {
  recordFields: Object.keys(record),
  fieldMappingsAvailable: Object.keys(this.apiConfig.fieldMappings || {}),
  sampleRecordData: {
    patientNumber: record.patientNumber,
    age: record.age,
    gender: record.gender
  }
});

// For each field being mapped:
console.log(`  📋 Mapping field: ${fieldName}`, {
  hasValue: value !== null && value !== undefined && value !== '',
  value: value,
  dataElement: config.dataElement
});
```

**What this shows:**
- Which fields are present in the record
- Which fields are available in the mapping configuration
- Sample data values to verify transformation worked correctly
- For each field: whether it has a value and what dataElement ID it maps to

#### During Upload (request logging)
```javascript
console.log('📤 Uploading record:', {
  rowNumber: record._rowNumber,
  endpoint: this.apiConfig.endpoint.url,
  payloadSize: JSON.stringify(payload).length,
  dataValueCount: payload.dataValues?.length || 0,
  payload: payload // Full payload for debugging
});
```

**What this shows:**
- Which row is being uploaded
- The exact endpoint URL
- Size of the payload (can indicate if data is missing)
- Number of data values being sent
- **The complete payload** being sent to DHIMS2

#### Response Logging
```javascript
console.log('📥 Response received:', {
  status: response.status,
  statusText: response.statusText,
  ok: response.ok
});

console.log('✅ Upload response:', {
  rowNumber: record._rowNumber,
  result: result,
  eventId: result.response?.importSummaries?.[0]?.reference || result.id || null
});
```

**What this shows:**
- HTTP status code (200 = success, 400+ = error)
- Whether DHIMS2 accepted the request
- **Event ID** returned by DHIMS2 (proves record was created)
- Full response from DHIMS2

### 2. Verification Feature

Added `verifyUpload()` method that tries to fetch the uploaded record back from DHIMS2:

```javascript
async verifyUpload(eventId) {
  // Try different possible endpoint patterns
  const possibleEndpoints = [
    `${this.apiConfig.endpoint.url}/${eventId}`,
    `${this.apiConfig.endpoint.url.replace('/events', '')}/events/${eventId}`,
    this.apiConfig.endpoint.url.includes('/api/')
      ? `${this.apiConfig.endpoint.url.split('/api/')[0]}/api/events/${eventId}`
      : null
  ].filter(Boolean);

  console.log('🔍 Attempting to verify upload with endpoints:', possibleEndpoints);

  for (const endpoint of possibleEndpoints) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
        method: 'GET',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          ...this.apiConfig.endpoint.headers
        }
      });

      if (response.ok) {
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log('✅ Verification successful! Event found:', {
          eventId,
          endpoint,
          data
        });
        return data;
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(`⚠️  Failed to verify at ${endpoint}:`, err.message);
    }
  }

  throw new Error('Could not verify upload - event not found at any endpoint');
}
```

**What this does:**
- Takes the event ID returned by DHIMS2 after upload
- Tries multiple possible GET endpoint patterns
- Fetches the event back from DHIMS2
- **Proves the data was actually saved** if fetch succeeds

### 3. Spot Verification for First Record

The first uploaded record in each batch is automatically verified:

```javascript
// Extract event ID from response for verification
const eventId = result.response?.importSummaries?.[0]?.reference ||
               result.response?.uid ||
               result.uid ||
               null;

// Optionally verify the upload (only for first record as a spot check)
if (index === 0 && eventId) {
  console.log('🔍 Performing spot verification for first record...');
  try {
    await this.verifyUpload(eventId);
    console.log('✅ Spot verification passed! Upload is working correctly.');
  } catch (verifyError) {
    console.warn('⚠️  Verification failed but upload may still be successful:', verifyError.message);
    // Don't fail the upload just because verification failed
  }
}
```

**Why only first record?**
- Verifying every record would double the API calls (upload + fetch)
- If the first one works, the rest should work too
- Keeps upload speed fast

### 4. Enhanced Error Detection

Added checks for DHIS2-specific error responses:

```javascript
// Check if DHIS2 reported any errors in response
if (result.status === 'ERROR' || result.httpStatusCode >= 400) {
  console.error('❌ DHIS2 reported error:', result);
  throw new Error(result.message || 'DHIS2 reported an error');
}

// Check for import summaries with errors
if (result.response?.importSummaries) {
  const summary = result.response.importSummaries[0];
  if (summary?.status === 'ERROR') {
    console.error('❌ Import summary error:', summary);
    throw new Error(summary.description || 'Import failed');
  }
}
```

**What this catches:**
- DHIS2 may return HTTP 200 but still report errors in the response body
- Import summaries can contain validation errors
- This ensures we catch all failure modes, not just HTTP errors

## How to Use the Enhanced Logging

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Find "DHIMS2 Batch Upload Extension"
4. Click "service worker" link (opens background console)

### Step 2: Upload a Test Record
1. Open the extension side panel
2. Upload an Excel file with valid data
3. Click "Start Upload"

### Step 3: Watch the Console Logs

You should see a sequence like this:

```
🚀 Starting batch upload: { total: 5, endpoint: "https://events.chimgh.org/api/41/events" }

🔨 Building payload for record: {
  recordFields: ["patientNumber", "age", "gender", "dateOfAdmission", ...],
  fieldMappingsAvailable: ["patientNumber", "age", "gender", ...],
  sampleRecordData: { patientNumber: "VR-A01-123", age: "45", gender: "Male" }
}

  📋 Mapping field: patientNumber { hasValue: true, value: "VR-A01-123", dataElement: "okahaacYKqO" }
  📋 Mapping field: age { hasValue: true, value: "45", dataElement: "UboyGYmr19j" }
  📋 Mapping field: gender { hasValue: true, value: "Male", dataElement: "cH9NADGoNwU" }
  ... (more fields)

📤 Uploading record: {
  rowNumber: 2,
  endpoint: "https://events.chimgh.org/api/41/events",
  payloadSize: 1523,
  dataValueCount: 12,
  payload: {
    program: "fFYTJRzD2qq",
    orgUnit: "duCDqCRlWG1",
    eventDate: "2024-01-15",
    status: "COMPLETED",
    dataValues: [
      { dataElement: "okahaacYKqO", value: "VR-A01-123" },
      { dataElement: "UboyGYmr19j", value: "45" },
      ... (all fields)
    ]
  }
}

📥 Response received: { status: 200, statusText: "OK", ok: true }

✅ Upload response: {
  rowNumber: 2,
  result: { status: "SUCCESS", response: { importSummaries: [{ reference: "ABC123XYZ" }] } },
  eventId: "ABC123XYZ"
}

🔍 Performing spot verification for first record...
🔍 Attempting to verify upload with endpoints: [
  "https://events.chimgh.org/api/41/events/ABC123XYZ",
  "https://events.chimgh.org/api/events/ABC123XYZ"
]

✅ Verification successful! Event found: {
  eventId: "ABC123XYZ",
  endpoint: "https://events.chimgh.org/api/events/ABC123XYZ",
  data: { event: "ABC123XYZ", program: "fFYTJRzD2qq", ... }
}

✅ Spot verification passed! Upload is working correctly.
```

## Diagnosis Guide

### Scenario 1: No Data Values in Payload
**Symptoms:**
```
📤 Uploading record: {
  dataValueCount: 0,
  payload: { dataValues: [] }
}
```

**Cause:** Field mapping mismatch - transformed record field names don't match `apiConfig.fieldMappings` keys

**Solution:**
1. Check the `recordFields` array in the build payload log
2. Check the `fieldMappingsAvailable` array
3. They should match! If they don't, the mapping transformation is broken

### Scenario 2: HTTP Error Response
**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Upload failed: { status: 401, error: "Unauthorized" }
```

**Cause:** Authentication issue - headers don't include valid session/credentials

**Solution:**
1. Re-run API discovery (extension needs to capture fresh auth headers)
2. Make sure you're logged into DHIMS2 when running discovery
3. Check if session expired

### Scenario 3: DHIS2 Reports Error Despite HTTP 200
**Symptoms:**
```
📥 Response received: { status: 200, ok: true }
❌ DHIS2 reported error: { status: "ERROR", message: "Validation failed" }
```

**Cause:** Data validation failed on DHIMS2 side (missing required fields, invalid values, etc.)

**Solution:**
1. Check the error message for specific field
2. Verify that field is being sent in the payload
3. Check if value format is correct (e.g., date format)

### Scenario 4: Verification Fails
**Symptoms:**
```
✅ Upload response: { eventId: "ABC123" }
🔍 Attempting to verify...
⚠️  Verification failed but upload may still be successful
```

**Cause:** Event was created but GET endpoint pattern is different

**Possible Reasons:**
- Upload succeeded, but GET endpoint has different authentication requirements
- Event ID format is different than expected
- There's a delay between creation and visibility (eventual consistency)

**What to do:**
- Check DHIMS2 web interface to see if events appear
- Try fetching manually via API (use Postman or browser)
- If events show up in UI, upload is working (verification endpoint just needs adjustment)

## Key Indicators That Upload is Working

### ✅ Upload IS Working If You See:
1. `📥 Response received: { status: 200, ok: true }`
2. `✅ Upload response: { eventId: "..." }` with actual event ID
3. `✅ Spot verification passed!`
4. Data appears in DHIMS2 web interface

### ❌ Upload is NOT Working If You See:
1. `❌ Upload failed: { status: 4XX or 5XX }`
2. `❌ DHIS2 reported error: { status: "ERROR" }`
3. `dataValueCount: 0` in the upload log
4. No event ID in the response

---

## Next Steps for Debugging

### If Logs Show Success But Data Missing:

1. **Check DHIMS2 Web Interface:**
   - Go to the exact program/org unit you're uploading to
   - Check if events appear with slight delay (refresh page)
   - Verify date filters aren't hiding the events

2. **Verify Event ID:**
   - Copy the event ID from console log
   - Try to find it manually in DHIMS2
   - Use DHIMS2 API browser to search for it

3. **Check Payload Contents:**
   - Look at the full payload in `📤 Uploading record` log
   - Verify all required fields are present
   - Check that dataElement IDs match what DHIMS2 expects

4. **Compare with Manual Entry:**
   - Submit one record manually in DHIMS2
   - Check what payload it sends (API discovery should capture it)
   - Compare that payload with what extension is sending
   - Look for any differences in structure or field values

5. **Test Single Record:**
   - Upload just 1 record
   - Watch all console logs carefully
   - Check DHIMS2 immediately after
   - If it appears, upload is working!
