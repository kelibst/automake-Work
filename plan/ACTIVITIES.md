### ‚úÖ Fixed Debug Mode Listener Persistence Issues
**Time:** Evening (Final fixes)
**Description:** Resolved critical issue where API listeners would stop working after capturing a few requests. Implemented comprehensive keepalive and health monitoring systems.

**Problem Identified:**
- Chrome service workers can go idle after ~30 seconds of inactivity
- WebRequest listeners were being garbage collected
- No mechanism to restore debug mode state after service worker restart
- Request tracking stopped after initial captures

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. Service Worker Keepalive
- Added interval-based keepalive mechanism (20-second ping)
- Prevents service worker from going idle
- Logs keepalive pings for monitoring
- Automatic startup on service worker initialization

#### 2. Listener Persistence
- Separated listener registration into dedicated methods
- `registerListeners()` - Adds all webRequest listeners
- `removeListeners()` - Safely removes listeners
- Bound listener functions stored to prevent garbage collection
- Explicit removal before re-registration to prevent duplicates

#### 3. Health Check System
- 10-second interval health check monitors listener status
- Logs request count for diagnostics
- Tracks total requests captured (`this.requestCount`)
- Ready for auto-recovery if listeners fail (future enhancement)

#### 4. State Persistence
- Debug mode state saved to chrome.storage
- Auto-restore on service worker restart
- Seamless experience across extension reloads
- User doesn't lose debug mode when service worker cycles

#### 5. Request Counter
- Added `requestCount` property to track captures
- Increments on each captured request
- Displayed in health check logs
- Helps diagnose capture issues

#### 6. UI Enhancements
- Live status indicator when listening
- Shows captured count in real-time
- Pulsing green indicator for active capture
- Better visual feedback

**Technical Changes:**

**Files Modified:**

1. [api-interceptor.js](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/background/api-interceptor.js)
   - Added `requestCount` and `listenerCheckInterval` properties
   - Created `registerListeners()` method
   - Created `removeListeners()` method
   - Created `startListenerHealthCheck()` method
   - Enhanced `startListening()` to use new methods
   - Enhanced `stopListening()` to clean up properly
   - Request counter incremented on capture
   - (+100 lines)

2. [service-worker.js](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/background/service-worker.js)
   - Added `startKeepalive()` and `stopKeepalive()` functions
   - 20-second interval to keep service worker alive
   - Auto-restore debug mode on startup
   - Reads debug mode state from storage
   - Automatically re-enables listeners if previously active
   - (+35 lines)

3. [Debug.jsx](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/sidepanel/pages/Debug.jsx)
   - Added live status indicator
   - Shows active capture count
   - Pulsing animation when listening
   - (+20 lines)

**Total Impact:** ~155 lines across 3 files

**User Benefits:**
- **Reliable capture:** Listeners stay active indefinitely
- **No manual intervention:** Auto-restores after extension reload
- **Better visibility:** Live status shows what's happening
- **Troubleshooting:** Health check logs help diagnose issues
- **Peace of mind:** Extension doesn't silently stop working

**Testing Recommendations:**
1. Open Debug tab ‚Üí should auto-enable
2. Navigate to DHIMS2 and perform multiple actions
3. Verify requests keep getting captured (check count increasing)
4. Reload extension ‚Üí debug mode should restore
5. Check console logs for health check pings every 10s

**Console Output Example:**
```
üöÄ DHIMS2 Extension: Service Worker Started
‚úÖ Keepalive started
üîÑ Restoring debug mode from previous session
üîç API Interceptor: Started listening...
‚úÖ WebRequest listeners registered
üíì Listener health check started
üíì Keepalive ping
üì° ‚úÖ CAPTURED API REQUEST: GET /api/me
üíæ Request stored with ID: 12345 | Total: 1
üîç Health check: Listeners active, requests captured: 1
üíì Keepalive ping
üì° ‚úÖ CAPTURED API REQUEST: POST /api/events
üíæ Request stored with ID: 12346 | Total: 2
```

**Next Steps:**
- Add auto-recovery if listeners fail health check
- Add manual re-sync button to force listener re-registration
- Monitor performance impact of keepalive mechanism

### ‚úÖ Added Request Filtering and Improved Instructions
**Time:** Morning
**Description:** Enhanced debug UI to help users distinguish between GET (data fetching) and POST (data submission) requests, with filtering to easily find the payloads that contain form field data.

**Problem:**
- User was seeing GET requests which only fetch existing data
- GET requests don't contain the form field values entered by user
- Confusion about which request to look at for field mapping
- No easy way to filter through many captured requests

**Solutions:**

#### 1. Enhanced Instructions
- Added prominent warning to click Save/Submit button
- Explained difference between GET (fetch) vs POST (submit)
- Highlighted that POST requests contain form field data
- Added visual tip box explaining request types

#### 2. Request Method Filter
- Three filter buttons: ALL, POST, GET
- Color-coded:
  - Purple: ALL requests
  - Green: POST requests only (‚úÖ what you want!)
  - Blue: GET requests only
- Shows filtered count vs total count
- Empty state when no requests match filter

#### 3. Better Visual Cues
- POST method shown in different color
- Request type badge more prominent
- Clearer instructions about what to look for

**Technical Changes:**

**Files Modified:**
- [Debug.jsx](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/sidepanel/pages/Debug.jsx)
  - Added `methodFilter` state
  - Created filter UI with buttons
  - Applied filter to payload list
  - Enhanced instructions with POST vs GET explanation
  - Added tip box
  - Empty state for filtered results
  - (+50 lines)

**User Benefits:**
- **Clear guidance:** Know exactly when to submit the form
- **Easy filtering:** Click "POST" to see only form submissions
- **Less confusion:** Understand why some requests don't have field data
- **Faster workflow:** Quickly find the right payload

**Usage:**
1. Open Debug tab (auto-listening)
2. Fill out DHIMS2 form completely
3. **Click Save/Submit button** (important!)
4. In Debug tab, click "POST" filter button
5. Look for the newest POST request
6. View the `dataValues` array - contains all field IDs and values

**What you'll see in a POST request:**
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "payload": {
    "program": "fFYTJRzD2qq",
    "orgUnit": "duCDqCRlWG1",
    "dataValues": [
      {
        "dataElement": "okahaacYKqO",
        "value": "VR-A01-AAG1234"
      },
      {
        "dataElement": "MSYrx2z1f8p",
        "value": "123 Main Street"
      }
      // ... all your form fields!
    ]
  }
}
```
