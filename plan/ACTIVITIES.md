### ✅ Fixed Debug Mode Listener Persistence Issues
**Time:** Evening (Final fixes)
**Description:** Resolved critical issue where API listeners would stop working after capturing a few requests. Implemented comprehensive keepalive and health monitoring systems.

**Problem Identified:**
- Chrome service workers can go idle after ~30 seconds of inactivity
- WebRequest listeners were being garbage collected
- No mechanism to restore debug mode state after service worker restart
- Request tracking stopped after initial captures

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. Service Worker Keepalive
- Added interval-based keepalive mechanism (20-second ping)
- Prevents service worker from going idle
- Logs keepalive pings for monitoring
- Automatic startup on service worker initialization

#### 2. Listener Persistence
- Separated listener registration into dedicated methods
- `registerListeners()` - Adds all webRequest listeners
- `removeListeners()` - Safely removes listeners
- Bound listener functions stored to prevent garbage collection
- Explicit removal before re-registration to prevent duplicates

#### 3. Health Check System
- 10-second interval health check monitors listener status
- Logs request count for diagnostics
- Tracks total requests captured (`this.requestCount`)
- Ready for auto-recovery if listeners fail (future enhancement)

#### 4. State Persistence
- Debug mode state saved to chrome.storage
- Auto-restore on service worker restart
- Seamless experience across extension reloads
- User doesn't lose debug mode when service worker cycles

#### 5. Request Counter
- Added `requestCount` property to track captures
- Increments on each captured request
- Displayed in health check logs
- Helps diagnose capture issues

#### 6. UI Enhancements
- Live status indicator when listening
- Shows captured count in real-time
- Pulsing green indicator for active capture
- Better visual feedback

**Technical Changes:**

**Files Modified:**

1. [api-interceptor.js](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/background/api-interceptor.js)
   - Added `requestCount` and `listenerCheckInterval` properties
   - Created `registerListeners()` method
   - Created `removeListeners()` method
   - Created `startListenerHealthCheck()` method
   - Enhanced `startListening()` to use new methods
   - Enhanced `stopListening()` to clean up properly
   - Request counter incremented on capture
   - (+100 lines)

2. [service-worker.js](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/background/service-worker.js)
   - Added `startKeepalive()` and `stopKeepalive()` functions
   - 20-second interval to keep service worker alive
   - Auto-restore debug mode on startup
   - Reads debug mode state from storage
   - Automatically re-enables listeners if previously active
   - (+35 lines)

3. [Debug.jsx](../dhims2-chrome-extension/src/sidepanel/pages/Debug.jsx)
   - Added live status indicator
   - Shows active capture count
   - Pulsing animation when listening
   - (+20 lines)

**Total Impact:** ~155 lines across 3 files

**User Benefits:**
- **Reliable capture:** Listeners stay active indefinitely
- **No manual intervention:** Auto-restores after extension reload
- **Better visibility:** Live status shows what's happening
- **Troubleshooting:** Health check logs help diagnose issues
- **Peace of mind:** Extension doesn't silently stop working

**Testing Recommendations:**
1. Open Debug tab → should auto-enable
2. Navigate to DHIMS2 and perform multiple actions
3. Verify requests keep getting captured (check count increasing)
4. Reload extension → debug mode should restore
5. Check console logs for health check pings every 10s

**Console Output Example:**
```
🚀 DHIMS2 Extension: Service Worker Started
✅ Keepalive started
🔄 Restoring debug mode from previous session
🔍 API Interceptor: Started listening...
✅ WebRequest listeners registered
💓 Listener health check started
💓 Keepalive ping
📡 ✅ CAPTURED API REQUEST: GET /api/me
💾 Request stored with ID: 12345 | Total: 1
🔍 Health check: Listeners active, requests captured: 1
💓 Keepalive ping
📡 ✅ CAPTURED API REQUEST: POST /api/events
💾 Request stored with ID: 12346 | Total: 2
```

**Next Steps:**
- Add auto-recovery if listeners fail health check
- Add manual re-sync button to force listener re-registration
- Monitor performance impact of keepalive mechanism

- Added visual tip box explaining request types

#### 2. Request Method Filter
- Three filter buttons: ALL, POST, GET
- Color-coded:
  - Purple: ALL requests
  - Green: POST requests only (✅ what you want!)
  - Blue: GET requests only
- Shows filtered count vs total count
- Empty state when no requests match filter

#### 3. Better Visual Cues
- POST method shown in different color
- Request type badge more prominent
- Clearer instructions about what to look for

**Technical Changes:**

**Files Modified:**

  - Added `methodFilter` state
  - Created filter UI with buttons
  - Applied filter to payload list
  - Enhanced instructions with POST vs GET explanation
  - Added tip box
  - Empty state for filtered results
  - (+50 lines)

**User Benefits:**
- **Clear guidance:** Know exactly when to submit the form
- **Easy filtering:** Click "POST" to see only form submissions
- **Less confusion:** Understand why some requests don't have field data
- **Faster workflow:** Quickly find the right payload

**Usage:**
1. Open Debug tab (auto-listening)
2. Fill out DHIMS2 form completely
3. **Click Save/Submit button** (important!)
4. In Debug tab, click "POST" filter button
5. Look for the newest POST request
6. View the `dataValues` array - contains all field IDs and values

**What you'll see in a POST request:**
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "payload": {
    "program": "fFYTJRzD2qq",
    "orgUnit": "duCDqCRlWG1",
    "dataValues": [
      {
        "dataElement": "okahaacYKqO",

**Files Updated:**
- [API_FIELD_MAPPING.md](../API_FIELD_MAPPING.md) - Added discovered field IDs with ✅ markers
- Removed "Missing Data Elements" section - all critical fields now mapped

**Impact:**
- ✅ Complete API field mapping achieved
- ✅ Ready to build data cleaner with all 16 fields
- ✅ Can now process full Excel uploads including Additional Diagnosis and Cost
- ✅ No more unknown fields blocking implementation

**Documentation Created:**
- [FIELD_CONFIGURATION.json](../FIELD_CONFIGURATION.json) - Complete field configuration with all 16 fields, transformation algorithms, validation rules, and sample payloads (250 lines)
- [DISCOVERY_COMPLETE.md](../DISCOVERY_COMPLETE.md) - Comprehensive discovery phase summary with field list, transformations, and next steps (280 lines)

**Next Steps:**
1. ~~Fetch option sets for Additional Diagnosis~~ (uses same 1,706 codes as Principal Diagnosis)
2. Begin implementing data cleaner module with complete field mappings
3. Build Excel parser to handle all 16 fields
4. Create validation engine with full field set
