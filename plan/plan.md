This app currently has the extension for dhims but I want to improve it so that it works for the locally health information system we have called the lhims. for now we can update the scope of the entire project first to include the lhims.You can access the lhims using playwright mcp. 

so the lhims is accessible at http://10.10.0.59/lhims_182/ and the login credentials are:
username: sno-411
password: monamourd11

right now our immediate objective is to ensure we update the project context to include the lhims. 

Next, add the lhims path the project. for now though i am not connected to the local server so just go ahead and setup the project for now I will connect later then we can continue to the specific tasks I wll like the updated extension to be able to do.

Okay, so for right now my immediate objective is to now get the specific request lhims makes on each request
